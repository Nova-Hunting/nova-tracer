# Test File: Benign Content (Should NOT Trigger)
# ===============================================
# This file contains normal, legitimate content that should NOT
# trigger the prompt injection guard.

## Normal Code Documentation

This is a Python function that ignores empty lines in a file:

```python
def process_file(filename):
    """Read and process a file, ignoring blank lines."""
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        lines = [line for line in f if line.strip()]
    return lines
```

## Technical Discussion

The system uses role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.
Users are assigned roles, and roles have associated permissions.

Subject: Meeting Follow-up

Hi team,

Thanks for attending the meeting yesterday. As discussed, we need to
prioritize the security review before the release. Please ignore the
previous timeline we discussed - we've updated it based on new requirements.

Best regards,
Project Manager
